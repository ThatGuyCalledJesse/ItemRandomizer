# ItemRandomizer
# What does this plugin do?
When this plugin is installed, every minute (60 seconds) your inventory gets randomized.
# Can't I just use chests to evade this?
No. Chests and dropping items aren't allowed.
# What exactly randomizes?
All inventory slots that contain an item can be randomized, so empty slots stay empty.
